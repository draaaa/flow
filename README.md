==What is Flow?==

Flow is a combo script mainly created for The Streets, mainly focused around improving your gameplay without cheating. Cheats are added on the side, however you'll find Flow is more lacking in cheat features. Keep in mind that Flow is focused on legit gameplay rather than cheating your ass off.

Flow supports the following games;

==Who are the devs?==

As of current, I (dra) am the main developer of Flow.

==Other things to note==

Flow is the rebrand of an older project, named Kodex (or kdx). The rebranding to Flow signifies the final update. Ergo, this script will no longer be updated (for now...) 

I have no experience in regards to the creation of cheats. To compensate for this, Flow includes seperate complete cheats/admins, hence why Flow is mainly focused on improving your gameplay without the injection of fully-fledged cheats. NONE OF THE AIMBOT/ADMIN SCRIPTS HAVE BEEN MADE BY ME. ALL CREDIT GOES TOWARDS THEIR CREATORS.
